# fake-job-detection-individual
The rising number of fraudulent job postings has made it difficult for applicants to identify real opportunities. This project aims to detect fake or fraudulent job listings using Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP). The system classifies job postings as Real or Fake based on textual content and metadata.
